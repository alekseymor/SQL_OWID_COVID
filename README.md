# SQL_OWID_COVID

# Dataset obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

### Setup:
# Prior to getting this COVID dataset into SQL, I rearranged the 
# 'population' column so that it would be in column E (instead of BK).
# This modification will simplify future dataset manipulations.
# Additionally, I split the dataset into 'cases' and 'vaccinations'
# tables.
